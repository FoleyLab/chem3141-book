the\nQED-CIS-1 ansatz can be written as a linear combination of the QED-HF reference and products of all possible single excitations out of the QED-HF reference.  The QED-HF reference involves the product of an electronic Slater determinant with the photon vacuum state |\\Phi_o\\rangle |0\\rangle, so single excitations can occur as electronic excitations from an occupied orbital \\phi_i to a virtual orbital \\phi_a, the raising of the photon number state from |0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1\\rangle, or both.  We therefore write the QED-CIS-1 wavefunction for state I as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:QED-CIS-1}\n\\Psi_I = c_0^0 |\\Phi_0\\rangle |0\\rangle +\n\\sum_{i,a} c_{ia}^0 |\\Phi_i^a\\rangle |0\\rangle +\nc_0^1 |\\Phi_0\\rangle |1\\rangle +\n\\sum_{i,a} c_{ia}^1 |\\Phi_i^a\\rangle |1\\rangle \\tag{9}.\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the coefficients c denote the contribution of a given term to the wavefunction and we have denoted the electronic excitations in the subscript and the photonic excitations in the superscript of these coefficients. For the case of multiple modes, the photonic basis states will be augmented to consider all possible combinations of the occupations of those modes within a maximum photon number.  These coefficients, and the corresponding energy eigenvalues for a given QED-CIS-1 state I, may be obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix built in the basis shown below in Eq. (10).  We spin adapt this basis such that |\\Phi_i^a\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\Phi_{i\\alpha}^{a \\alpha} \\rangle + |\\Phi_{i\\beta}^{a\\beta}\\rangle \\right), where \\alpha and \\beta label the spin orbitals as being occupied by spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively.
