Below, we will calculate the potential energy curve along the bond stretch coordinate for H$_2$ using one of the simplest procedures for finding approximate solutions to the electronic part of the Schrödinger equation, the Hartree-Fock approach. You can read more about Hartree-Fock theory in [this notebook](https://deprincelab.github.io/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks/hartree_fock/index.html).

    "Now, we note that we can arrive at part of the selection rule story by considering only the symmetry of the wave functions. Recall that QHO wave functions can have either even or odd symmetry, based on the symmetry of the Hermite polynomials. For even $v$, the wave functions are even in the displacement coordinate. For odd $v$, the wave functions have odd symmetry. The matrix element that determines whether a vibrational transition is allowed or forbidden is $\\langle \\psi_{v^\\prime} | x | \\psi_v \\rangle$. This integral will only be non-zero if the products of the symmetries of $\\psi_{v^\\prime},$ $\\psi_{v},$ and the operator, $x,$ is even. Because $x$ is odd, the products of the symmetries of $\\psi_{v^\\prime}$ and $\\psi_{v}$ must be odd. This condition is consistent with but weaker than the condition derived above.\n",

    "Before moving on, we note that, in addition to the $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$ selection rule, there are other, more physical rules that apply to different types of vibrational spectroscopy. For IR spectroscopy, transitions will only be observed for vibrational modes that result in a change in the dipole moment of the molecule (called \"IR active\" modes). We can rationalize this rule by recognizing that the molecule interacts with an electric field through its dipole moment. If the dipole moment does not change with the vibration, then an oscillating electric field cannot couple to that particular vibrational mode. For Raman spectroscopy, the selection rule is different. \"Raman-active\" vibrational modes result in a change in the polarizability of the molecule."

    "In addition to frequency information, vibrational analysis can be used to confirm whether a stationary point that has been identified via a geometry optimization is a minimum in all of the coordinates, a transition state, or some other high-order saddle point. Each of these cases can be differentiated by the number of **imaginary** frequencies that result from the vibrational analysis. Recall that the harmonic frequency is related to the square root of the second derivative of the potential along one of the normal modes. If the potential is a minimum along this coordinate, then the second derivative is positive, and the frequency is real (because the square root of a positive number is real-valued). If the potential is a maximum along this coordinate, then the second derivative is negative, and the frequency is imaginary (because the square root of a negative number is imaginary). Hence, if all of the frequencies obtained from the vibrational analysis are real, then the molecule is at a minimum all of coordinates. If there exists one and only one imaginary frequency, then the molecule is at a transition state. If there are multiple imaginary fruequencies, then the molecule is at some high-order saddle point that is not a transition state. \n",
