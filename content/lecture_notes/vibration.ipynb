    "Now, we note that we can arrive at part of the selection rule story by considering only the symmetry of the wave functions. Recall that QHO wave functions can have either even or odd symmetry, based on the symmetry of the Hermite polynomials. For even $v$, the wave functions are even in the displacement coordinate. For odd $v$, the wave functions have odd symmetry. The matrix element that determines whether a vibrational transition is allowed or forbidden is $\\langle \\psi_{v^\\prime} | x | \\psi_v \\rangle$. This integral will only be non-zero if the products of the symmetries of $\\psi_{v^\\prime},$ $\\psi_{v},$ and the operator, $x,$ is even. Because $x$ is odd, the products of the symmetries of $\\psi_{v^\\prime}$ and $\\psi_{v}$ must be odd. This condition is consistent with but weaker than the condition derived above.\n",

    "Before moving on, we note that, in addition to the $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$ selection rule, there are other, more physical rules that apply to different types of vibrational spectroscopy. For IR spectroscopy, transitions will only be observed for vibrational modes that result in a change in the dipole moment of the molecule (called \"IR active\" modes). We can rationalize this rule by recognizing that the molecule interacts with an electric field through its dipole moment. If the dipole moment does not change with the vibration, then an oscillating electric field cannot couple to that particular vibrational mode. For Raman spectroscopy, the selection rule is different. \"Raman-active\" vibrational modes result in a change in the polarizability of the molecule."

    "### Transition State Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to frequency information, vibrational analysis can be used to confirm whether a stationary point that has been identified via a geometry optimization is a minimum in all of the coordinates, a transition state, or some other high-order saddle point. Each of these cases can be differentiated by the number of **imaginary** frequencies that result from the vibrational analysis. Recall that the harmonic frequency is related to the square root of the second derivative of the potential along one of the normal modes. If the potential is a minimum along this coordinate, then the second derivative is positive, and the frequency is real (because the square root of a positive number is real-valued). If the potential is a maximum along this coordinate, then the second derivative is negative, and the frequency is imaginary (because the square root of a negative number is imaginary). Hence, if all of the frequencies obtained from the vibrational analysis are real, then the molecule is at a minimum all of coordinates. If there exists one and only one imaginary frequency, then the molecule is at a transition state. If there are multiple imaginary fruequencies, then the molecule is at some high-order saddle point that is not a transition state. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\rho_i = \\frac{e^{-E_i/kT}}{\\sum_j e^{-E_j/kT}}\n",

Recall that $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left ( \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\right )$. As such, if $\\mu$ is small (e.g., H$_2$, HCl), then the spacing between levels will be large, and, at room temperature, the $v=0$ state will be the most populated. On the other hand, if $\\mu$ is large (e.g., I$_2$), the spacing between levels is much smaller, and other vibrational states may become thermally accessible.\n",

    "The harmonic oscillator is a powerful model that is widely used for molecular vibrations among many other phenomena; however, it does not\n",
    "capture several important features of real molecular vibrations.  Here we list some of the more important features of real molecular vibrations that the harmonic oscillator model misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overtones and Selection Rule Violations**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In addition to transitions that obey the selection rule, $\\Delta v = \\pm 1,$ a vibrational spectrum may also include **overtones**, which correspond to transitions that violate this rule (e.g., $v=0 \\to v=2$ for the first overtone, $v=0 \\to v=3$ for the second overtone, etc.). Why are such features observed, if, mathematically, the selection rule suggests that these transitions should not occur? The reason is that the actual potential energy curve corresponding to a vibrational mode is not harmonic. Real molecular potentials are **anharmonic** - they deviate from the parabolic shape of the harmonic potential, typically becoming \"softer\" (less steep) at larger displacements. As such, the selection rules derived for the harmonic oscillator are not strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy Level Spacing**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The energy levels of a quantum harmonic oscillator are evenly spaced. On the other hand, vibrational energy levels in a real molecule become more closely spaced as the vibrational quantum number increases. This decreasing spacing occurs because real molecular potentials deviate from the parabolic harmonic form, becoming increasingly flat at larger displacements. Hence, the QHO model is better suited to the description of low-energy vibrational states than high-energy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hot Band Transitions**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Given that energy levels become more closely spaced as the vibrational quantum number increases, transitions like $v = 0 \\to v = 1$ will be associated with a larger frequency than transitions like $v = 1 \\to v = 2$ in real molecules (they would be identical in the harmonic oscillator model). Hence, in real molecules we observe distinct **hot band** transitions that correspond to transitions between $v \\to v'$ where $v > 0$ and $v' = v + 1$. In this nomenclature, the $v = 1 \\to v = 2$ transition is called the first hot band, the $v = 2 \\to v = 3$ transition is called the second hot band, and so on. Hot bands become more prominent at higher temperatures when higher vibrational states are thermally populated, which is why they're called \"hot\" bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dissociation and Bound States**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The QHO model predicts that there are infinitely many **bound** vibrational states, with quantized energies. In a real molecular system, however, the vibrational energy levels **converge** toward the dissociation limit for the molecule. Beyond this point, there exists a continuum of **unbound** states. This convergence occurs because the anharmonic potential becomes increasingly flat as the bond stretches toward the breaking point. A different way of saying this is that real molecules can dissociate after the atoms stretch beyond the point of bond breaking, but the harmonic oscillator does not dissociate.\n",
