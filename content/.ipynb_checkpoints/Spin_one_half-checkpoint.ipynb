    "# Chapter 2: Introduction to Spin 1/2\n",
    "[Jay Foley, University of North Carolina Charlotte](https://foleylab.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this workbook, students should be able to\n",
    "- Identify the eigenstates of z-spin\n",
    "- Use the eigenstates of z-spin as a basis for computing expectation values of x-spin and y-spin \n",
    "- Explain the concept of matrix representations of operators\n",
    "- Utilize NumPy to build matrix representations of operators\n",
    "- Utilize NumPy to identify eigenstates of x-spin and y-spin\n",
    "- Utilize NumPy to confirm the commutation relations for the matrix representations of operators\n",
    "- Use the Design Recipe to compose functions\n",

    "#### Summary\n",
    "We will use Python and NumPy to illustrate basic formalism of spin 1/2 in quantum mechanics.  We assume familiarity with this formalism; for background on this topic, we recommend you read [this chapter on Spin](https://foleylab.github.io/chem3141-book/content/note05.md).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spin angular momentum is an observable in quantum mechanics and has\n",
    "associated operators with eigenstates.  Traditionally, the components of angular momentum are represented along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, and we have \n",
    "Hermitian operators associated with each component ($\\hat{S}_x, \\hat{S}_y, \\hat{S}_z$), along with the square magnitude $\\hat{S}^2$.  For particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons, these component operators \n",
    "all have exactly two eigenstates with eigenvalues $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$; hence we talk about the formalism of spin for these systems as the formalism of spin 1/2.\n",
    "In this workbook, we will introduce matrix representations of each of these component operators, and the eigenstates will then have vector representations.  We will specifically introduce the eigenvectors of the matrix associated with $\\hat{S}_z$ as the basis vectors for any state of spin 1/2.  We will then be able to write the matrices associated with \n",
    "$\\hat{S}_x$ and $\\hat{S}_y$ in this basis, and perform useful computations with them, including finding their eigenstates and verifying so-called commutation relations between these operators."

    "# Functions\n",
    "In Python, functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help organize code, making it more modular and easier to maintain. A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by a name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. Inside the function, you can include any number of statements that define what the function does. Functions can take inputs, called parameters, and can return a value after processing. By calling a function by its name, you can execute the code within it whenever needed, making your programs more efficient and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example function that multipies an input number by 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def multiply_by_three(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Multiplies the input by three.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Arguments\n",
    "    ---------\n",
    "    x: A number to be multiplied by three.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "    -------\n",
    "    result: The input multiplied by three.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    multiply_by_three(5) == 15\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    result = 3 * x\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** Your function must be indented relative to the `def` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a practice called [Design Recipe](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ahchinaei/teaching/20165/csc148/function_design_recipe.pdf) to design our functions.  \n",
    "The Design Recipe can be implemented in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header:** Define the function's name, input parameters, and their data types. Specify the data type of the return value.\n",
    "2. **Purpose:** Write a concise one-line description explaining the function's purpose.\n",
    "3. **Examples:** Provide examples of how to call the function with different inputs and the expected outputs. These examples will be used to test the function.\n",
    "4. **Body:** Write the actual code that implements the function's logic, based on the header, purpose, and examples.\n",
    "5. **Test** Test your function aon all your example cases; try to identify additional tricky cases.\n",
    "6. **Debug/Iterate** If your tests fail, re-read your code, check your logic, check your syntax, and fix any mistakes that you catch.  If you cannot catch mistakes, think about additional test cases that can help reveal flaws in your logic.  Continue until your function passes tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate this process by examining a function that will print a message some specified number of times, and also return the repeated message.  We want the repeated message to be printed all on a single line, and we do not want any spaces between the sub-messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through this step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header** Doest the function name make sense?  Are the input parameters adequate for what we will need to pass to the function?  Is the return statement adequate for what we want the function to return?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose** Does the purpose string adequatly capture the functions behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Examples** One example is given; add a second example!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Body** Read the body of the function and track what is happening in each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test** Test your code against your two examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Debug/Iterate** Did your tests pass?  If yes, great!  If not, you know what to do!"

In quantum mechanics, we associate the possible outcomes of measurements with the eigenvalues of Hermitian operators corresponding to the observable being measured.  In this notebook, we have been talking about the observable of spin angular momentum, which is a vector quantity. We have been specifically looking at the operators and eigenstates related to the z-component of spin angular momentum, denoted $S_z$. We have seen that this operator has two eigenstates,\n",

This is a very special situation, because typically speaking, when a vector is multiplied by a matrix, the result is a new vector that points along a new direction and has a different magnitude.
